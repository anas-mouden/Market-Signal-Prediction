# Market Signal Prediction

Exploratory data analysis and machine learning pipeline for **financial mid-price movement prediction**.  
The project builds signals from high-frequency limit order book features, applies feature reduction via **PCA**, trains multiple classifiers, and backtests trading strategies with transaction costs.
